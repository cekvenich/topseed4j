# topseed4j
Helper library for Java. Over the few projects we work on, these are some things we often need - we share this in our projects - so it is easier at runtime.

Likely you don't want to be here other than to view the dependencies/BOM in lib folder. Downstream support for bake(jbake fork), jade4j and loadGen.

Use in gradle like this:

      dependencies {
        compile "com.github.appthings:topseed4j:v1.xx.XX"
      }
      // where xx.XX is the latest version.

Released into maven central: http://oss.sonatype.org/#welcome
